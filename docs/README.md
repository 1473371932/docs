# 特性
features:
 - title: Universal Map
   details: Based on the leading AutoMetrics mechanism, eBPF and Wasm are used to generate an universal map of the production environment with zero code instrumentation.
 - title: Distributed Tracing
   details: Based on the leading AutoTracing mechanism, eBPF and Wasm are used to implement distributed tracing with zero code instrumentation, leaving no blind spots.
 - title: Continuous Profiling
   details: Based on the leading AutoProfiling mechanism, eBPF is used to collect profiling data of production processes with less than 1% overhead and zero code instrumentation.
