# Overview

DeepFlow presents the status of the infrastructure, CPU, memory, and other indicators in a list format by docking with Prometheus data. It currently supports the display of data from both `hosts` and `containers`.

- [Host](./host/)
- [Container](./container/)

Note: When using this feature, you need to push Prometheus node_exporter data to DeepFlow. For the push method, refer to [Integrating Prometheus Data](../../../integration/input/metrics/prometheus/)
