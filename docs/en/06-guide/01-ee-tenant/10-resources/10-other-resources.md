# Other Resources

Other resources include information related to other resources in the network or system, such as physical network elements, collection points, physical links, and legends.

## Physical Network Elements

Physical network elements refer to the hardware devices in the network, including routers, switches, firewalls, gateways, etc. These devices realize data communication and transmission by connecting and exchanging network traffic. We provide features allowing the view and download of related information, like zones, types, etc., on the physical network elements page, as well as support the creation, modification, and deletion of physical network elements.
