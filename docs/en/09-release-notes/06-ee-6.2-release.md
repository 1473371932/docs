- Reviewed all system alarm texts
- Environment threshold alarm strategy for all packet loss of collectors and data nodes

# Resources

# System

- APIs
  - **Querier now supports PromQL**
    - Supported querying DeepFlow native metrics through PromQL

  - Querier SQL API
    - Provided **Trace Completion API `tracing-completion-by-external-app-spans`**: The caller passed in a set of APP Spans (no need to be stored in DeepFlow), got their upstream and downstream SYS/NET Spans, and added infrastructure and uncodified service tracing capabilities to traditional APM, [see specific document here](../integration/output/query/trace-completion/)
