# v6.2.6.5 [May 17, 2023]

## New Features (GA)

- AutoTracing
  - Provides a trace completion API `tracing-completion-by-external-app-spans`: the caller inputs a group of APP Spans (no need to be stored in DeepFlow), obtains their upstream and downstream SYS/NET Spans, thereby enhancing the tracing capacity of traditional APM for infrastructure and untracked services. [Detailed Documentation](../integration/output/query/trace-completion/)
- WASM Plugin
  - Adds a new WebAssembly Plugin mechanism, enhancing the capability to parse private protocols and standard protocol field. [Detailed Documentation](../integration/process/wasm-plugin/)
