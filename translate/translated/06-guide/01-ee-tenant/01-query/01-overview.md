DeepFlow is a highly automated observability platform that provides metrics, events, tracing, and log data of applications and networks. With the ability of AutoTagging, it injects unified attribute tags into all observable data. In dealing with these vast amounts of data, DeepFlow not only offers productized analysis capabilities but also the ability for quick searching. As an efficient information retrieval tool, the search bar can quickly and accurately perform searching and filtering when dealing with massive data. This section will focus on how to use the DeepFlow search bar.

The search bar of DeepFlow can be divided into four types, and this section will provide detailed interpretation of each type of search box and its common application scenarios.

- [Service Search Bar](./service-search/)
