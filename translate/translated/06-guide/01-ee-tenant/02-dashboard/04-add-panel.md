# Adding Subviews

A view is composed of one or more `subviews`. This section explains how to add `subviews` to a `view`.

Currently, `subviews` can only be added to `views` from the function page, which includes `metrics`, `applications`, and `network` function subviews.

**Step 1**: Navigate to the function module page where the subview is to be added, such as clicking `① Application-Service` to go to the `Service Overview` page.
