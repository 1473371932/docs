# Histogram

A histogram visualizes the distribution of data by dividing the data into several continuous intervals (also known as "boxes" or "buckets"), and plotting the frequency (or rate) of data within each interval. Histograms help intuitively present the central tendency, dispersion, and shape of the data.
