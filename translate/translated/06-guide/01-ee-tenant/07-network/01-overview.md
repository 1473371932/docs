# Overview

The DeepFlow's network module has abundant features which allow users to perform real-time monitoring on the path traffic and network performance. The module encapsulates information from resource nodes, flow logs, NAT tracking, PCAP downloads, traffic distributions, and resource inventory. It enables real-time monitoring, analysis, and assessment of the transmitted data flow, latency, and packet loss ratio. Hence, it identifies and resolves network congestion, faults, and security issues promptly, enhancing the stability and reliability of the network and ensuring its efficient operation.

Here is a detailed explanation and user guidance for each page.
