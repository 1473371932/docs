# NAT Tracing

NAT tracing can initiate tracing for any TCP four-tuple or five-tuple through the proprietary algorithm of DeepFlow to automatically trace the traffic before and after NAT. The NAT tracing page displays the metrics corresponding to the four-tuple of the clicked data in the form of a table. By clicking on `tracing`, you can initiate tracing for the four-tuple.
