- SQL
  - Adds count operator to metrics to calculate the number of rows in the original data
- Universal Service Map
  - Optimizes the service list
    - Only shows performance metrics when the service is called
    - Supports switching the signal source through signal_source
    - Adjusts the default display metrics and shows a bar graph representing the relative size of the metrics
  - Adds service topology
    - Supports defining an integrated business access topology for both cloud and non-cloud environments
- Application
  - Distributed Tracing
    - When adjusting the split ratio of the page by sliding right, do not scale the flame graph
    - Supports distributed tracing from the network Span as a starting point
    - Supports showing the collection network card information of the network Span in the flame graph
    - The quick filter box on the left supports quick filtering and switching of the signal source
  - Continuous Profiling
    - Supports the linked display of tables and flame graphs
    - Optimizes the merging logic of Function Stack in the flame graph
    - Compresses the storage of Function Stack in ClickHouse
    - Support for eBPF collection of OnCPU Profile data for compiled (Golang/Rust, etc.) and interpreted (Java, etc.) languages
- Infrastructure
  - Adds Host and Container pages, displayed based on Prometheus metrics
- Events
  - Splits the Event page into Resource Change, File Read/Write, and Alert events pages
- GUI
  - Enhances snapshot search capabilities: supports sorting, condition copying, and other operations
  - Search bar supports pasting `Key: value` search conditions
  - Search bar supports modifying the operator of existing conditions
  - Simplifies the search conditions of the page and the conditions carried by the right-sliding page, improving usability
  - Comprehensive optimization of page UI
  - Optimizes the Quick Filter box on the left: supports search filtering, displays matched data quantity, supports filtering of metric value range, supports switching query region, supports switching data table
  - Supports opening multiple right-sliding pages in succession and switching between different right-sliding pages
  - The event data displayed in the right-sliding page can switch to view the events of the client or server separately
  - The pop-up page for viewing the database field supports displaying the table name
  - Supports viewing the search conditions of the current subview

# Views, Metrics, Alerts, Reports

- Views
  - Supports dragging to modify the table size
  - Optimizes the display details of the bar chart
  - Adds a new subview type: Overview Diagram
  - Refactoring of the subview editing page
  - Optimizes the layout of subview buttons
  - Merges Line Chart with the Top Line Chart
  - Optimizes the display when template variable names are too long
  - Supports dragging to order the template variable list
- Metrics
  - Supports inputting PromQL to query data
- Alerts
  - Supports creating alert policies directly (no need to create views)
  - HTTP Push Endpoint supports using tags to render push content
  - Email Push title supports using variables
  - Optimizes the display of system alert events
- GUI
  - Unifies search condition input boxes of Subview Editing Page, Metric Search Page, and Alert Policy Editing Page

# Resources, Systems

- Resources
  - Optimizes display of POD list, VPC list, availability zone list, region list, adds container node quantity, collector status column
  - Supports sync of `OpenKruise` CloneSet and Advanced StatefulSet workload types
  - Support independent configuration of sync intervals for different cloud platforms
  - Supports sync of IP address on loopback interface (usually VIP)
- Integration
  - Prometheus Integration
    - PromQL supports topk, bottomk functions
    - PromQL API supports RFC3339 time format
    - Supports obtaining HTTP Header in RemoteWrite as an additional Label
    - Optimizes the storage performance of RemoteWrite, and optimizes query performance of RemoteRead and PromQL
  - OpenTelemetry Integration
    - Supports operation without ClickHouse
- Agent
  - Plugin
    - New "so plugin" support capability, providing C SDK
    - Wasm Demo: Parses error code in HTTP payload, and reassigns response_code and response_exception
    - Wasm Demo: Parses Protobuf message in Payload
  - The cycle reporting interval of long-lived streams is changed from absolute 0 seconds (at the beginning of every minute) to relative 0 seconds (in relation to the start of the stream every 60 minutes)
    - Advantage: Reduces pressure of sending stream logs at absolute 0 seconds, avoid splitting streams that last less than 60 seconds into two stream logs
  - Configuration
    - Supports configuration of CPU affinity and priority
    - Adds kprobe-blacklist configuration item, sets the port number blacklist for eBPF data collection, avoiding collection loops
    - Adds l4_log_ignore_tap_sides and l7_log_ignore_tap_sides for setting positions to ignore in flow logs and invocation logs, respectively, to reduce the amount of data collected
  - Adaptation
    - Supports operation in Tencent TCE's DPDK host machine
    - Removes HostNetwork requirement for container collector
    - Supports environments where the number of matched network card (tap_interface_regex) results exceeds 255
    - Supports running as a Sidecar within a business Pod
    - Supports deployment as a blue whale plugin
- Server
  - Supports configuration of system alert sending mailbox on the page
  - The default value for the auto-deletion time of the anomaly controller and data nodes is set to 30 days
  - Unifies storage of alert events in ClickHouse
  - Detects changes in resource information, and pushes updates to the Agent in real time
  - Supports disabling of K8s cluster auto-discovery function, so it can be used as a synced K8s cluster for public cloud
  - Supports specifying (fixing) the Agent that syncs K8s resource information
  - Adds deepflow identifier to all deployed dependent HostPath paths
- CLI
  - Releases deepflow-ctl for MacOS
