# v6.3.9 [2023/09/14]

## New Features

- AutoMetrics
  - Added support for parsing FastCGI protocols.
  - Partial support for parsing MongoDB protocols (Thanks to `mickeyzzc`: [FR](https://github.com/deepflowio/deepflow/issues/3618), [PR](https://github.com/deepflowio/deepflow/pull/3899).
- AutoTracing: Added support for invoking APM's Trace API to supplement tracing data.
- Profiling: Added support for eBPF-based collection of OnCPU Profile data from compiled languages (such as Golang/Rust) and interpreted languages (like Java) (Thanks to `@ic0xgkk`: [FR](https://github.com/deepflowio/deepflow/issues/2494)).
- Agent:
  - Now supports running as a Sidecar within service Pods.
  - Can be deployed as a BlueWhale Plugin.

# v6.3.8 [2023/09/07]

## New Features

N/A

## Improvements

- Server: Refactored Exporter Interface, making it easier to add additional Exporter capabilities (Thanks to `@jiekun`: [FR](https://github.com/deepflowio/deepflow/issues/3926), [PR](https://github.com/deepflowio/deepflow/pull/3932).

# v6.3.7 [2023/08/31]

## New Features

- AutoMetrics: Now supports collecting the statement-id of MySQL calls in order to correlate COM_STMT_EXECUTE with COM_STMT_QUERY, enabling SQL query tracing (Thanks to `@wuzongling`: [FR](https://github.com/deepflowio/deepflow/issues/3590)).
- Agent: Now supports the synchronization of IP addresses on loopback interfaces, which are typically VIPs.

## Improvements

- AutoMetrics: Added an endpoint field to the application aggregated metrics table.
- Profiling:
  - Optimized the merging logic of Function Stack in flame graphs.
  - Compressed Function Stack storage in ClickHouse.
- Agent: Removed the requirement for HostNetwork from K8s Agent.
- CLI: Released MacOS version of deepflow-ctl (Thanks to `@zjj1002`: [FR](https://github.com/deepflowio/deepflow/issues/3710)).

# v6.3.6 [2023/08/24]

## New Features

- AutoTracing
  - Can now trace calls before and after hosted ALB/SLB services.
  - Added configuration option allow_multiple_trace_ids_in_tracing_result to allow Span with multiple TraceIDs in tracing results.
- OpenTelemetry Integration: DeepFlow Server can now run independently of ClickHouse (Export l7_flow_log to otel-collector).

## Improvements

- Prometheus: Improved storage performance for RemoteWrite, and query performance for RemoteRead and PromQL.
- Agent: Now supports CPU affinity and priority configuration.

# v6.3.5 [2023/08/10]

## New Features

- AutoMetrics: Recognizes RST disconnect in SLB probes as normal behavior.
- SQL: Added the 'count' operator to measure counts of raw data rows.
- Prometheus Integration: PromQL now supports the 'topk' and 'bottomk' functions.

## Improvements

- Wasm Demo
  - Decodes the error code in HTTP Payload and reassigns response_code and response_exception.
  - Decodes Protobuf messages in Payload.
- Agent
  - Added options l4_log_ignore_tap_sides and l7_log_ignore_tap_sides for ignoring logging positions in order to reduce data collection volume.
  - Now supports environments where tap_interface_regex matching results exceed 255.

# v6.3.4 [2023/07/27]

## New Features

- AutoTagging: Added the ability to automatically associate K8s containers by PID, solving the issue of marking container resource information in HostNetwork Pod data from eBPF.
- Prometheus Integration: Now supports the retrieval of HTTP Header from RemoteWrite as additional Label.
- Server: Can now synchronize workload types such as CloneSet and Advanced StatefulSet from OpenKruise (Thanks to `@lockerroom`: [FR](https://github.com/deepflowio/deepflow/issues/3368)).
- Agent: Introduced the capability to support .so plugins and provided a C SDK.

## Improvements

- Agent: changed the interval for periodical reporting of long-streams from absolute 0 second (at the start of each minute) to relative 0 second (relative to the start of the stream at integer multiples of 60 minutes).
  - Benefit: Reduced pressure of sending flow logs at absolute 0 second, avoiding splitting life cycle shorter than 60 seconds into two flow logs.
- Server: Real-time push to Agent when resource information changes are detected.

# v6.3.3 [2023/07/13]

## New Features

- AutoMetrics: Dubbo protocol now supports parsing the 'event' and 'serialization_id' fields.
- AutoTracing: Now supports parsing TraceID from MySQL statements (Thanks to `@zhangfane`: [FR](https://github.com/deepflowio/deepflow/issues/2985), [PR](https://github.com/deepflowio/deepflow/pull/2999)).

## Improvements

- Prometheus Integration: PromQL API now supports RFC3339 time format.
- Agent
  - Introduced 'kprobe-blacklist' configuration option to set a blacklist of port numbers for eBPF data collection, preventing the creation of data collection loops.
  - Support for eBPF has been extended to the 5.10.0-106.18.0.68.oe2209.x86_64 kernel (Thanks to `@innlym`: [FR](https://github.com/deepflowio/deepflow/issues/3542)).
- Server: The synchronization interval for different cloud platforms can now be configured independently.

# v6.3.2 [2023/06/29]
